Life cycle of a Data science Projects

1. Data collection Strategy -- from company side, 3rd party API's , surveys
2. Feature Engineering -- Handling missing Values

why are their Missing values?? Survey -- Depression survey-- 

1. Information people will not insert
2. Filling data in hurry so missing
3. They hesistate to put down the information 
4. Survey informations are not that valid
5. Men -- hesitate to show -- salary
6. Women -- hesitate to show -- age 
7. people may have died in past 10 year -- NaN

Data science projects -- Dataset should be collected from multiple sources

what are the different types of missing data?

# Missing Completely at Random, MCAR: 
    A variable is missing completely at random (MCAR) if the probability of being missing is the same for all the observations. When data is MCAR, there is absolutely no relationship between the data missing and any other values, observed or missing, within the dataset. In other words, those missing data points are a random subset of the data. There is nothing systematic going on that makes some data more likely to be missing than other.




Data that will be missing --
1. Continous data (can have any value)
2. Discrete-continous data
3. Discrete data
4. Categorical data
